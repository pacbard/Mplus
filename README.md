Mplus syntax editor for sublime text 3
==============

http://bkeller2.github.io/Mplus/

* Includes syntax highlighting for inputs and outputs, code snippets, auto completion, a dedicated theme, and ability to run inputs in Mplus.

# Usage #

* Simply open up any .inp or .out file with sublime text 2. To start a new file, first open a new tab ( **Control + N** ).
* Save this file with whatever name you would like and end it with a .inp. This will turn on the Mplus highlighting.
* To run an input hit **Control + B**. This will run the input with Mplus and open the corresponding output.
* Another nice feature of Sublime Text 2 is it allows you to create projects under the "Project menu". This will allow you to open up a project with multiple inputs/outputs, close out of the program, and then load it back how you left it.
* Furthermore, by going to View > Layout you can create multiple columns of files. This is useful for comparing inputs or outputs of different models.

* To open the outputs in Sublime Text 2 it requires Sublime text 2 to be installed in "/Applications/".
 
Windows:
* Requires a path in the command line to run Mplus using the 'mplus' command (usually done by default install).
* Requires Sublime text 2 to be installed in "C:\Program Files\Sublime Text 2\"

Linux:
* Requires a path to be able to run mplus via command line (i.e., mplus example.inp).
* Requires a path to be able to run sublime text using "subl" via command line. E.g., for sublime text installed in "/opt/" :

```
sudo ln -s /opt/Sublime\ Text\ 2/sublime_text /usr/bin/subl
```

# Still in development, stay tuned! #
**To do:**
* Add templates for specific common models and analysis.
* Overhaul the theme and language definitions.
